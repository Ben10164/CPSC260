Explaining the U variable since its number is easier to explain

first u=4294967295, which is also 0xffffffff, 
also known as the max of an unsigned int, 
however when you convert it to an unsigned int, 
0xFFFFFFFF is -1. 
This is because if the leftmost byte in an 
unsigned number is above 7, that means that the leftmost bit in the byte
is a 1. This means the number is negative, and in this case with ffffffff, it is -1

This also explains the next 3 lines, where the hex is the same, yet the values are different
This all relates to if the datatype will register the leftmost bit as being a 1 affecting the rest of the 
calculation relating to the value of the number

The last 2 lines of the program (also explained above) also show how the 
specific tags of %u and %d will output the number as an unsigned value and a signed values
